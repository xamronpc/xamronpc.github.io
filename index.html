                    <h2><i class="fa fa-id-badge"></i> About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My name is Norman, a passionate Document Controller based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>
                    <p>Previously worked with China State Construction Engineering Corporation and was assigned as a Document Controller (QAQC Department) for
                        ETIHAD RAIL Project in Ghweifat-Ruwais, Western Region, Abu Dhabi U.A.E.</p>
                    <p>For the past 15 years, I have been associated with several companies related to the construction industry, specializing in documentation
                        and clerical tasks such as preparation of correspondences, transmittals, and submittals for materials, drawings, and project reports.
                        Dail√ø maintenance of all register logs as well as uploading data using Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) like Primavera
                        Projects Unifier by MUSANADA, ORACLE Aconex and Etihad Rail Engineering Document Management System - Production Environment (EPFM).</p>
                    <p>I can describe myself as very resourceful and ambitious at the same time. I can find solutions, get creative and solve problems without
                        needing the help of co-workers or managers. I know when to ask for help, and I don't hesitate to approach the concerned person if I need
                        assistance. But when it is possible to handle something without occupying the valuable time of others, I do it and consider myself very
                        good at it.</p>

                        <p>My primary role involves managing and maintaining the Inspection Test Request and Material Inspection Request for Etihad Rail Project Package 2A under the QAQC Department. This includes manually managing and maintaining the Inspection Test Request, which consists of over 85,000 files, and the Material Inspection Request, which has over 1,500 files using Microsoft Excel. </p>
                        <p>In addition to these responsibilities, I assist other departments and subcontractors with the preparation and submission of inspection requests. This involves uploading all approved documents to the EDMS application using OpenText Documentum.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Working on these two projects has made me realize the importance of being organized and practicing proper documentation discipline as a document controller. Specifically, I was in charge of assisting the closing manager in the preparation of documents for the extension of time for the first project, while simultaneously starting the documentation process for the second project.</p>

However, my discipline in practicing proper documentation played a significant role in helping my company win the case.</p>
