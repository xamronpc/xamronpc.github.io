          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi. My name is Norman, I have years of work experience as a Project Secretary and Document Controller with several companies across United Arab Emirates.</p>
          <p>I am currently working as a Document Controller (QAQC Department) with China State Construction Engineering Corporation for ETIHAD Rail Project at Ghweifat-Ruwais, Western Region in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>
          <p>For the past 15 years, I used to work with several companies related to the construction industry. I specialized in the administrative and clerical tasks like preparation and submission at the same time of correspondences, reports, drawings, materials, and transmittals. Maintaining all register logs daily, filings in manual and electronic using Document Management System applications like MUSANADAs Projects Unifier, ORACLE Aconex, and ETIHADs EPFM.</p>
          <p>I can describe myself as being highly resourceful and ambitious at the same time. I find solutions, get creative, and solve problems without needing the help of coworkers or managers. When it is possible to handle something without occupying the time of others, I confidently do it all by myself. I know when and how to approach others for help, and I always look for the right timing if I need assistance as a sign of professionalism and respect.</p>
